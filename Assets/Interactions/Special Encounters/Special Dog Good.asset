  title: Demon's best friend
  textBox: As the train approaches the tunnel that leads out of Hell, you notice
    a huge crowd of bad souls gathering close by. They are eager to jump aboard,
    but there's one thing that stands in their way - your loyal dog. The canine's
    presence has struck fear into the hearts of the wicked souls, and they are hesitant
    to make their move.
