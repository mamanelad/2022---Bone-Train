  title: The Tricks of Hell
  textBox: 'As you stand at the gates of Hell, ready to leave with the rescued souls
    in tow, you witness a fierce battle between Mamanos, Lord of the Underworld and
    Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies. It seems that Mamanos is furious with Beelzebub
    for its failed attempt to trick you with the "gift" of free fuel. You recall
    your suspicion of their kindness and the decision to refuse their offer. Now,
    it appears that your caution has paid off, as you watch Mamanos pummel Beelzebub
    with a wrathful fury. '
