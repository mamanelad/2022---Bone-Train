  title: Free riders
  textBox: As your train approaches the tunnel that leads out of Hell, you see a
    massive crowd of bad souls waiting to board. The knowledge that these entities
    are afraid of dogs provides little comfort, as you find yourself without a canine
    companion to protect your train. Despite your best efforts, some of the evil
    souls manage to clamber aboard, slipping past you in the chaos.
