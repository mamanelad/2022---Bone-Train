  title: Unexpected Encounter!
  textBox: A beat-up and sorrowful dog, with a soul as pure as gold, finds itself
    lost in the depths of Hell. Surrounded by malicious spirits that revel in its
    suffering, the dog's fate seems sealed. But, as if fate has intervened, you have
    been presented with an opportunity to rescue this forlorn creature. A train awaits,
    offering a path to salvation, but at a price. The journey comes with a warning,
    for when you take the dog on board, the evil spirits that torment it will come
    along, unseen forces that threaten to disrupt your journey.
