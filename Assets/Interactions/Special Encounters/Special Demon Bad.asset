  title: No free gifts in hell
  textBox: As you prepare to leave the gates of Hell with the good souls you have
    rescued, Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies suddenly appears. Reminding you of the
    "gift"  he provided, he now demands a favor in return. He wants some of the precious
    souls you have gathered in exchange for safe passage out of this fiery realm.
    The demon's eyes gleam with mischief as he warns that granting his wish is the
    only way to escape the depths of Hell.
