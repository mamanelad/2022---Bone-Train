  title: drop off station
  textBox: The drop station for bad souls stood before you, with a dark and ominous
    structure. A group of demons greeted you with a sly grin and offered to help
    you drop off all your bad souls. They also explained that red dots on your map
    symbolize bad souls drop stations and that you can always count on them to provide
    a safe and efficient way to drop off your bad souls.
