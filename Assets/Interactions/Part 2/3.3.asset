  title: 'The Pitiful Creature''s Plea '
  textBox: As you continue your journey, you come across a pitiful creature cowering
    on the side of the tracks. It's small and weak, with a look of despair on its
    face. The creature pleads with you, explaining that it needs fuel to bring to
    its master, otherwise it will be punished. It claims to have nothing to give
    in return but you have a gut feeling that it might have something of value to
    offer.
